/**
 * Define group permissions.
 *
 * This hook can supply permissions that the module defines, so that they
 * can be selected on the group permissions page and used to grant or restrict
 * access to actions the module performs.
 *
 * Permissions are checked using Group::userHasPermission().
 *
 * @return
 * An array whose keys are permission names and whose corresponding values
 * are arrays containing the following key-value pairs:
 * - title: The human-readable name of the permission, to be shown on the
 *   permission administration page. This should be wrapped in the t() function
 *   so it can be translated.
 * - description: (optional) A description of what the permission does. This
 *   should be wrapped in the t() function so it can be translated.
 * - restrict access: (optional) A boolean which can be set to TRUE to indicate
 *   that site administrators should restrict access to this permission to
 *   trusted users. This should be used for permissions that have inherent
 *   security risks across a variety of potential use cases (for example, the
 *   "administer filters" and "bypass node access" permissions provided by
 *   Drupal core). When set to TRUE, a standard warning message defined in
 *   user_admin_permissions() and output via
 *   theme_user_permission_description() will be associated with the permission
 *   and displayed with it on the permission administration page. Defaults to
 *   FALSE.
 * - warning: (optional) A translated warning message to display for this
 *   permission on the permission administration page. This warning overrides
 *   the automatic warning generated by 'restrict access' being set to TRUE.
 *   This should rarely be used, since it is important for all permissions to
 *   have a clear, consistent security warning that is the same across the
 *   site. Use the 'description' key instead to provide any information that
 *   is specific to the permission you are defining.

 * Add mass group operations.

   * - On the one hand we need a group id to save the creator's GroupMembership
   *   to the database, requiring us to first save new Group entities before
   *   saving their creator memberships.
   * - On the other hand, saving a new entity causes the insert hook to be
   *   invoked, leaving room for buggy behavior should one try to load the
   *   newly created group's members in aforementioned hook.
   *
   * To solve this without overriding EntityAPIController::save() and without
   * having to fiddle with either module or hook weight, we place the code here
   * because GroupController::invoke() is called right after the actual insert
   * and we are sure to have a group id already.

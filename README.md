Group
=====

The Group module allows you to create arbitrary collections of your content and
users on your site and grant access control permissions on those collections.

Out of the box, Backdrop only allows a person to view, create or edit the
different content types you create. However, you might want to be able to let
them view or edit all content types, but only in a specific section of the site.

Group also allows you to create communities. Users of the site can become
members of a Group. You can then decide what membership of a Group entitles
them to, such as access to content only available to members of that Group.
There can also be different levels of membership to a Group so, for example,
you can have administrative members who can create content and basic members
who can only view content within the Group.
